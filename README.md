This repository contains:

* euler_vs_analytical.py            (contains code to generate data and plot from euler forward)
* gradient_descent_methods.py       (contains the class "momentum_gym" and code to run training)
* mlp_vs_analytical.py              (contains code for the long training with adam and gdm)
* one_dim_diffusion_eq.py           (contains diffusion equation class)
* save_load_test.py                 (contains unit test for saving and loading training sessions)
* save_load_to_file.py              (contains code to load and save pickle files)
* simple_mlp.py                     (contains MLP class)
* simple_mlp.py                     (contains code to generate data and plot for the gradient
                                    descent methods that we considered.)


The folder "data" contains *some* of the data to generate plots.
These data can be generated again by running the relevant files.

Unfortunaly, the data used to make figure 2 and 3 is a few Gb in size,
and we can not find a good way to upload it. Therefore, it is not included.

See the methods section in our report for more details on the classes
"simple_mlp" and "one_dim_diffusion_eq.py", as well as "momentum_gym".
