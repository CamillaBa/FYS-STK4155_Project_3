# FYS-STK4155_Project_3

This repository contains:

* long_training_session.py          (comparison to analytical solution from long training session)
* gradient_descent_methods.py       (contains the class "momentum_gym" and code to run training)
* methods.py                        (contains code to load and save pickle files)
* one_dim_diffusion_eq.py           (contains diffusion equation class)
* save_load_test.py                 (contains unit test for saving and loading training sessions)
* simple_mlp.py                     (contains MLP class)

The folder data contains the data to generate plots.
Execute the files "one_dim_diffusion_eq.py", "long_training_session.py",
to produce the plots from the report.

See the methods section in our report for more details on the classes
"simple_mlp" and "one_dim_diffusion_eq.py", as well as "momentum_gym".
